This is an educational API designed for learning purposes, functioning as a virtual book library. It's a RESTful API built using Node.js with the Express framework and Nodemon for automatic server restarts. The API connects to a MongoDB database, where a list of books is stored, simulating a digital book collection. It enables interactions with the database to perform operations such as adding, retrieving, or updating the book list. The API was initially available on localhost.
